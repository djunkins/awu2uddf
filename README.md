This is the README file for AWU2UDDF version 1.1.3

AWU2UDDF is a simple app to export scuba diving depth and water temperature
data collected by an Apple Watch Ultra and stored in Apple's HealthKit data
store. The data is exported in an XML file following the Universal Dive Data
Format (UDDF) format. Once it is exported, it can be loaded in Subsurface
dive log or any other diving log program that supports UDDF.

A quick "Getting Started" guide can be found at:
